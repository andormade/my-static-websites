1. Never add external dependencies, only use the standard libraries.
2. Always run the tests after code modifications.
3. Don't ignore warnings in the build or test outputs.
4. Don't modify the README unless it is explicitly prompted.
5. If the snapshot tests are failing only because of white space differences, feel free to update them.
6. Always run the tests in single threaded more.
7. The template processors in this project are just partial implementations of the original ones.
